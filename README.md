Project coded in C++ 14 up to 4/22/2025

Version: This project runs in C++ 14, there is no guarantee it will work with different versions. 
Files: You must have the games_cleaned_3.csv file in the same directory as the project executable. All other files are needed in your project as well, except for the other csv files.
Running: Run main and follow the printed directions in an IDE terminal. Note that when selecting a Steam game to compare with, you are choosing the title as seen on the store page. The titles are case-sensitive.
Results: The program will display the "most similar" games to your entered game based off of its "similarity score," which is printed for the user. The details of the score aren't displayed, but it may be good to know that it is based off the game's tags and genre.
